25.04

- Created base for the game with player movement, shooting bullets, weapon, base calculations for damage/bullet size etc.

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
26.04

- Added player sprite and animation
- Added map background and implemented duplicating it + deleting non-visible map parts
- Added new bullet sprite
Next working on implementing enemies

Second part:
- Implemented base for enemies
- Renaming and project structure
- Some minor things
Next working on project structure and changing guns so that it will be possible to assign a bullet (or multiple different bullets) to a gun

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
27.04

- Guns and projectile spawning rewritten, new weapons can be easily added and projectile patterns can be easily added and attached to weapons
Might not seem like much but it's a huge progress since adding new weapons and new bullets alongside new bullet patterns is now trivial

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
28.04

- Created an enemy spawner with waves 
- IProjectilePattern is now a general IMovementPattern

Next work on finalizing enemies (implementing attacks and giving gold to the player, dropping loot) and add tests for all sort of calculations
Next would be implementing some differnet types of weapons and add some sort of unlocking system for them
After that is done, GUI is next, it should work well and be generic for all weapon types.
If the implementation of that is generic, adding new weapons/enemies/waves etc should be trivial, and the game is done!
